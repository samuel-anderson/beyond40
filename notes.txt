    - Populates ratings and total reviews text
    - Calculates rating bar percentage widths
    - OnClick for Write Review button will open empty popup box (where potential form can be)
        - I left it unfinished intentionally so that I didn't use too much time focusing on items that weren't apart of the scope of the assignment

    - Pulsing animation for 5 star rating 
    - OnHover opacity effect for rating bar 
    - Onhover effect for reviews heading 
    - OnHover effect for action buttons (pressing illusion)
